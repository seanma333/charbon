The orphanages are in fact for-profit businesses, and the children within perform hours of work daily in exchange for shelter.</p> <p>These megacorporations use brainwashing and social manipulation techniques to ensure brand loyalty from those they raise.</p> <p>This brainwashing is incredibly effective, and many Korporate Kids feel that they owe their lives to the corporations and will willingly work with them for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Occasionally there are rebels who break the mental programming and see their corporation for what it really is.</p> <p>Korporate Kids have been raised and directed from a very young age to fill the specific roles picked for them by their handlers. You may choose which role your handler assigned to you, or work with your GM to decide.</p>",
