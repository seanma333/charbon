	"name": "Wormer",
	"description": "<p>Wormers are born in the offworld colonies, or to parents from the colonies. They are named after the wormholes that voyagers must travel through to reach the colonies.</p> <p>The low gravity of the colonies has caused wormers to grow unusually tall and lanky compared to people from Earth. Those born in the colonies must rely on their natural hardiness to survive the harsh unknowns.</p> <p>In the offworld colonies, wormers are used as slave labor, and treated no better than synths. Many wormers work for food and board, born into contracts naively signed by their ancestors who believed they were leaving Earth for a better life.</p> <p>Wormers who live on Earth have defied the quarantine and snuck back onto the planet, gaining citizenship as soon as they set foot on Earthâ€™s soil. Treated as less than human, wormers are usually blamed for most of the petty crimes in the modern world and are quite often the victims of crime themselves.</p>",
